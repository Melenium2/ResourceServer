### GET /load<?link>
The `load` endpoint loads one image into the assets folder. `link` is a request parameter. This parameter should contain URL for the image.

```
### POST /load/batch
The `/load/batch` endpoint loads multiply images into the assets folder. Data must be in json format.
For example:
```sh

    "https://someresourceurl/image2.jpg",
    "https://someresourceurl/image3.png",
    ...
]
```
Response (a hash map of the given url for the new filename):
```sh
{
    ...
    "https://someresourceurl/image1.png": "3344ba80a6b5476ce8cb7b8f2e864cb3.png(|jpg)",
